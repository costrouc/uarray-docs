Welcome to uarray's documentation!
==================================

`uarray <https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/uarray>`_ is an ambitious
project to provide a high level array operation interface that can
compile down into low level machine code. In addition uarray can
provide predictions on the runtime and performance of a computation.

The `pills <pills.html>`_ are provided as a resource for understanding
the foundations of uarray which is based on the work of Lenore
Mullin's thesis "A Mathematics of Arrays". We hope that this work may
soon have a huge effect on the linear algebra field and fields that
depend upon it.
